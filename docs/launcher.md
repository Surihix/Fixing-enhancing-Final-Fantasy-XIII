When you launch the game for the first time, there will be a launcher that you can use to customize the visuals, and the audio language.
<br><br>

If you want the game to run in fullscreen or windowed mode, then there are options for that in the **Screen settings**. this setting has to be set to **Fullscreen Display Mode** as the windowed mode option limits 
you from customising the resolution.

There is the **Resolution settings** tab which allows you customise the game resolution.

If you want to play with English or Japanese audio, the option to do so is in the Sound settings tab. this option is not available if you got the ASIA region version of the game.

Here are some settings that could help in getting the game look good as well run better if you have a low end hardware.

<ins>Anti aliasing</ins>

The Anti aliasing setting is the least demanding setting in this game. you can crank it up to higher values if running on your native screen resolution, to reduce the jagged lines seen on the edges of 3d models 
and objects.

*Note: if you intend to follow the DSR method in this guide, then set this to 2x as you will end up hurting performance, if set to x16.*

<ins>Shadow resolution</ins>

Shadow resolution is the setting that you might need to do a bit of tweaking to get it looking right.

At lower settings, the shadows will look softer but jagged at the edges with the shadow volume having noticeable artifacts. as you go to higher settings the jagged edges and the artifacts on the shadow volume 
reduces, but the shadow volume starts to look hard and dense making them look quite blocky.

I would suggest setting this to 4096 x 4096. this setting produces shadows that do have jagged edges but thankfully it is not easily noticeable. the benefit with this setting is the somewhat softer and neat 
shadow volume which makes the shadows look a bit better when they are cast on the character's face.

**Caution:** if you intend to follow the DSR method in this guide and have an slightly mid end GPU, then set this to 4096 x 4096 itself as the higher 8192x8192 setting will end up in lowering the framerate of the 
game significantly.

Once you are done setting up in the launcher, Untick the checkbox that says *Do not show this Window again*, and click on the **Start game** button for a test run.
This is to see if the game opens correctly and if in case it doesn't open, then skip to the next section of this guide.

If the game opens correctly, then Skip the Intro cutscene by pressing either the **ENTER** key on your keyboard or the **A** or **Cross** button on your controller.

Once you are in the main menu, press the **ESC** key and select the Yes option in the small window with your mouse cursor to close the game.
