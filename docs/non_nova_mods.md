This mod by **Team NGS**, enhances the textures used in the game and makes it look even better than what the base game provides.

If you want to install the **HD Models Plus** mod, then install this HD Project mod by using the "Install a category of Textures" option and make sure that you DO NOT USE 
the last PCs category option. 

Using the category method of installation would require you to open the mod installer multiple times after each Category is done installing.

## FFXIII HD Full Motion Video
This mod by **Team NGS** and **MJB** replaces the lower resolution FMVs or the pre rendered cutscenes that the PC version of this game comes by default with much higher quality 
cutscenes.

**Compatibility notice:** This mod is not available for installation via Nova Chrysalia. if you want to install mods from both the frameworks, then you can install this mod now.

This is for the **English audio** version

This is for the **Japanese audio** version
<br>https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy13/mods/20

These newly re encoded FMV's are much better than the original PS3 version and the new Xbox one enhanced version's FMV's and I would say it's a must have mod for this game on PC.

If you want to install for both audio languages, then the size of the game will go up to 240gb which is quite a lot. so to save space, decide which audio language you want to play 
the game with and then download your needed version accordingly.

If you have the **ASIA/JAPAN** version of the game and are okay with the Japanese language only restriction, then make sure you download the Japanese audio version of the mod.

The installation instructions for this mod is provided in the respective mod pages by the mod author. please follow them correctly to install this mod.

## Original Japanese BGM

The Promise, The Promise - Sunleth Waterscape and Chocobos of Cocoon (chasing dreams) songs are different in the original PS3 Japanese release of the game.
Square Enix did not add these songs to the Japanese Voice Over language options on PC. so no matter what language you choose to play the game in, the songs will always be the ones from the English version of the game.

This mod by **vavrinko** adds in those songs from the original Japanese release of the game to the PC version's Japanese Voice Over files.
