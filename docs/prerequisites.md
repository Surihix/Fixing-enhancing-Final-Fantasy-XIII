Before proceeding with this guide, I recommend to start afresh with a clean game install mostly to avoid issues that can arise with previous mod installs and modifications done to the game files.
<br><br>Make sure that you are using the latest version of Windows 10/11 operating system with up to date graphic drivers.

## Checking your Installation
I suggest installing the game on a drive other than ``C:``. the operating system can place certain restrictions on the ``C:`` drive which in turn can prevent some of the patches or mods from being installed correctly.

Steam by default will set up a directory on your ``C:`` drive when you begin installing the game and so you will have to change the directory in the installer window to a different directory on a different drive.

Now if you have already installed the game on your ``C:`` drive, then you can move the game folder to a different other drive with the "*Move install folder*" option. this option can be accessed by right clicking on this game's title text from the left side of your steam library and by selecting "*Properties*". then in the new window that has opened, click on the **LOCAL FILES** section. the "*Move install folder*" option should be present in this section.

If something is not clear, then you can refer to the instructions given in this page linked below:

## Verifying Game Integrity
We will use the "*Verify Integrity of game files..*" option to check whether the game has installed correctly.

You can access this option by right clicking on this game title from the left side of your steam library and selecting "_Properties_". then in the new window that opens, click on the "**LOCAL FILES**" section. the "_Verify Integrity of game files.._" option should be present in this section.

Doing this verification should check your game files and re download files that were modified or got corrupt somehow during the download or installation process, thereby making sure that your game is properly installed.
