Before proceeding with this guide, I recommend to start afresh with a clean game install mostly to avoid issues that can arise with previous mod installs and modifications done to the game files.
<br><br>Make sure that you are using the latest version of Windows 10/11 operating system with up to date graphic drivers. once you are sure that everything is up to date, you can proceed to the next step in this guide.
<br><br>
## Checking your Installation
I suggest installing the game on a drive that is not the C drive. certain PCs might have restrictions placed on this drive which in turn can prevent some of the patches and mods from not working properly with the game.
<br><br>Steam by default will set up a directory in the C drive when you begin installing the game and you will have to change that directory in the installer window to another drive on your PC.
<br><br>Now if you had already installed the game on to your C drive, then you can move the game folder to any other drives on your PC with the "_Move install folder_" option.
<br><br>You can access this option by right clicking on this game title from the left side of your steam library and selecting "_Properties_". then in the new window that opens, click on the "**LOCAL FILES**" section. the "_Move install folder_" option should be present here.
<br><br>If you do not see your drive in the drop down box then you can follow the instructions from this page here:

## Verifying Game Integrity
We will use the "_Verify Integrity of game files.._" option to check if all the files are properly downloaded and installed.
<br><br>You can access this option by right clicking on this game title from the left side of your steam library and selecting "_Properties_". then in the new window that opens, click on the "**LOCAL FILES**" section. the "_Verify Integrity of game files.._" option should be present here.
<br><br>Doing this verification should check your game files and re download only the files that were modified, got corrupt somehow due to download..etc thereby making your game installation proper.
