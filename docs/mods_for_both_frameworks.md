## PS3 and X360 button prompts

The PC version comes with Xbox based button prompts and although the prompts are correct, the icons lack the correct button colors which the 360 version of this game has.
The game also does not come with the Playstation controller icons, which can make it somewhat difficult to play this game if you are playing with a Dualshock controller.

This mod by [b]Krisan Thyme[/b] comes with the options to install either the proper 360 controller icons or the Playstation 3 icons.

**Compatibility notice:** The mod can be installed via the Nova Chrysalia mod manager. skip this if you want to install mods from both the frameworks as we will be installing the Nova version of this mod.

We will now have to copy these files inside the game's data folder which is inside the **white_data** folder. the location for that is give below:
<br>`steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY XIII\white_data\`

To get to this location first select this game title on your Steam library, right click and select Properties. then in the new window go to **LOCAL FILES** and select the *Browse...* option.

This should open the root directory and from there you can get inside the **white_data** sub folder

- Inside the **white_data** folder, right click and select the paste option. the files will all be moved into this folder.

- Now open the [b]Install Console Button Prompts[/b] batch file. 
<br>[previewicon=28775498;sizeOriginal,inline;BtnPrompts_4.png][/previewicon]

- You will be presented with this command prompt window:
<br>[previewicon=28775499;sizeOriginal,inline;BtnPrompts_5.png][/previewicon]

- Press the number 1 button on your keyboard if you want the game to display Playstation Button prompts or press the number 2 button on your keyboard if you want the game to display the colored Xbox Button Prompts.
After pressing your desired selection, press enter and an patching process should start. once finished it should say in the black window finished. close the window now and thats it. 

Once its installed, delete the mod folder, the Install Console Button Prompts batch file, and the readme file from this folder.
