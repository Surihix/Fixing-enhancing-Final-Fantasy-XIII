## PS3 and X360 button prompts

The PC version comes with Xbox based button prompts and although the prompts are correct, the icons lack the correct button colors which the 360 version of this game has.
The game also does not come with the Playstation controller icons, which can make it somewhat difficult to play this game if you are playing with a Dualshock controller.

This mod by **Krisan Thyme** comes with the options to install either the proper 360 controller icons or the Playstation 3 icons.

**Compatibility notice:** The mod can be installed via the Nova Chrysalia mod manager. skip this if you want to install mods from both the frameworks as we will be installing the Nova version of this mod.
