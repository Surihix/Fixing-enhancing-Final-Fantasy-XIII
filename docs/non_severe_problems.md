# Non Severe Problems

## Pre rendered cutscenes are poorly encoded for the PC version

The Pre rendered cutscenes (that makes this game a bit huge for its time on PC) are encoded at a slightly lower bitrate compared to the PS3 version. its not that big of an issue for new players, but it can be one for returning players from the PS3 version. 

Please check out the [FFXIII HD Full Motion Video](non_nova_mods.md#ffxiii-hd-full-motion-video), [Better Quality audio for Pre rendered movies](mods_for_both_frameworks.md#better-quality-audio-for-pre-rendered-movies) and the [4k Pre-rendered Cutscenes with Higher Quality audio v2.0](mods_for_both_frameworks.md#4k-pre-rendered-cutscenes-with-higher-quality-audio-v20) mods to improve the quality of the cutscenes.

## No English audio option for Asia/Japan version of the game

There are three versions of the game that is being sold on Steam depending on which region you purchased the game from. these are the three versions that are available for purchase on steam directly. I am basing this with the help of Steam DB site:
- FINAL FANTASY XIII - this is the NA version
- FINAL FANTASY XIII (RU/IN/CIS) - this is the EU version and the one I have.
- FINAL FANTASY XIII (JAPAN/ASIA) this is the Asian and Japan region version which does not come with the english audio.

If you want the English audio, then refund the copy of the game if you can on steam and get the version sold on Square Enix's online store. this version on the Square Enix store will give you an Steam CD key for the EU or NA version of the game. this is an legal method that I can recommend for those who bought the game, is in refund period and with a card or payment method that allows refund transfers to your card directly.

If you are stuck without the ability to refund then buy the game again on the Square Enix store or just play the game with the Japanese audio.
