An mod manager application called Nova Chrysalia is available for modding the 13 trilogy. it comes with whole suite of tools and options that allows one to edit 
and modify some of the game's files as well as manage multiple mod installs. 

This guide will try its best to illustrate the mod management side of things to you readers which is important for installing mods in a compatible manner.

As this mod manager comes with its own modding framework to manage mod installs, it leads to some compatibility issues with mods that were not created 
with this framework. 

The mods that don't follow the framework of this mod manager are categorized as Non Nova mods while the ones that are made with this mod manager's 
framework is categorized as Nova mods.

Some of the newer mods are made with this mod manager's framework and cannot be installed without Nova Chrysalia. 

Here is a table of compatible mods that are available for this game: 

N.B.: The mods that have (*) marking, requires the *Gameplay Tweaks and Hard Mode* mod to be installed.

From this table, I hope you have an rough idea on what all mods you want to install as well as decide which modding frameworks to follow. to keep it a bit neat, I have grouped the mods in two different sections according to the framework thereby making it easier to navigate and choose your desired framework to follow along.

There is also a way to have all of the mods from both the frameworks and this requires an specific mod installation order to be followed. 
The order would be to install the mods that do not have a nova version first and later install the rest of the Nova mods with the Nova mod manager.
